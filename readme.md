A scraper for The Realist, Paul Krassner's counterculture newsletter from the 50s until the noughties.
Everything is available at http://www.ep.tc/realist/, but I wanted to read it on my tablet, so it was easier to download the .jpgs.
I'm still a n00b, so instead of doing something to download every issue all at once, the best I could do so far was to choose an issue, set the number of pages it has, and voil√°! It downloads every issue to a folder or, if you prefer, a .zip.

Enjoy such classics has "Disneyland Memorial Orgy" and "The Parts that were left out of Kennedy's book"!

Plus:
Robert Anton Wilson!
Jean Shepperd!
Terry Southern!
and a cast of others
